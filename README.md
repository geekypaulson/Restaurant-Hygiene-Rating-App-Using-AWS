# Restaurant Hygiene Rating App Using AWS

Safety became an import factor during the pandemic situation and gaining the trust of customers became more difficult. The restaurant’s business completely depends on the rating. Nowadays the food delivery apps are rating the restaurants with “Best Safety” or “Max Safety” based on the COVID-19 safety guidelines followed by the restaurant staff. This rating would help customers in choosing the safest restaurants. Safety in terms means, sanitizing the kitchen, chefs equipped with gloves and masks, etc.

In regard to the problem faced, an application is to be built which would scan the chefs and check if they are working with all the safety measures. The methodology which this lab follows is using the AWS Cloud. Using the Rekognition, Lambda, S3 and API Gateway services of the AWS Cloud, this application will be built.
